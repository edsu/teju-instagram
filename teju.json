What it could not salve was the memories for these children of unmarried mothers, these gypsy children, these poor children: the angry shouts, the cold nights that cut like a blade, the hatred we naturally bear towards the weak and helpless, the terror of the long days in those mountains with their rough stones and vertiginousness and mocking beauty. #blindspot","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11348178_1060914013928091_230673862_n.jpg"},

In March 1498, the Nuremberg goldsmith and printer Anton Koberger published Ludovicus of Prussia’s \"Trilogium anime,\" for which Koberger’s godson Albrecht Dürer provided an illustration. Ludovicus, in his discussion of fantasia, touches on the composite nature of the chimera, that creature of legend whose hind parts were a dragon, the middle parts a goat, and the fore parts a lion. The world of dreams, Avicenna suggests, comes to pass when the rational brain gains unhindered access to the imagination’s storeroom of images. Dürer, considering the question of Beauty, wrote, \"I often see great art and good things while asleep which do not occur to me awake. However, when I wake up the memory of them is lost.\" But from time to time, in certain heightened states in certain individuals, the boundary between the chimeras seen in dreams and the discrete forms of waking life to blur. In these sudden rifts in the natural order of time, prodigies of vision in the guise of hybrid forms can appear briefly before the critical faculty intervenes and the world rights itself again.

When I made this photograph in Wannsee, I did not know that Caravaggio's The Incredulity of St Thomas was in Sanssouci. Has there been a more intense or more erotic demonstration of the sense of touch than in Caravaggio's painting? The split in Thomas’s shirt is the same size and shape as the wound in the side of Christ: both are eyes that short-circuit vision. Christ advises Thomas to surrender the sensual faculty in favor of the cognitive. But his hand, guiding Thomas's hand, says something different. Caravaggio, as usual, goes to that dark core where action splits from intention. I was based in Wannsee for the summer, and spent some of my time going to distant places in search of paintings by Caravaggio: to Madrid, Venice, Basel. I missed the Caravaggio right next door.

If the polygon of sun in the previous picture is light scooped out of darkness, and the russet wall in the picture before that is a river of color, the ribbon here is expert ink calligraphically snicked into a pale surface. From the flatness emerges the eventual meaning: something touching on something, a delicate form holding, for sustenance, a more solid form. The gesture is doubled: there are two ribbons. The gesture is doubled twice: there are two ribbons not only touching but actually looping around the column: they both touch on the column twice, and the entasis on the column itself echoes the soft give of the navy blue ribbons. The gesture is doubled three times: in a fresco upstairs (for this is the Palazzo Ducale in Mantova), a little girl extends her arm to gently hold on to the fingers of her brother who, with his other hand, holds their father’s hand: a length, a loop, a line. #blindspot","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11887061_1704624949750608_1087435997_n.jpg"},

In the spring of 1507, Albrecht Dürer returned from his second trip to Italy. He had seen Leonardo's oil sketches​, and been impressed by their use of drapery to suggest form, movement, wind, and light. A folded drapery is cloth thinking about itself. Under pressure from itself or the influence of external agents, a material adopts a topographical surface. A material, around the axis of itself, faces some part of itself, confounds its inside and outside. A drapery study of Dürer’s from 1508 shows the influence of a sketch of Leonardo’s from the 1490s, now in the Louvre. Folding​: ​​\"​falten​\":​ to bring something together, and also to iterate that bringing together: a joining and a repetition. In the crumples, pleat​s​, gathers, creases, ​falls, ​billows, ​and ​twists of cloth is a regular irregularity that is like the surface of water, like the channels of air, like God made visible. The human is the divine enfolded in skin. (There​ i​s a curious comment about folds in John​'​s account of the ​R​esurrection: a folded cloth that remained folded​ even as events unfolded​: ​\"​Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus​'​ head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.​\"​) To master the fold is to suggest a form not made by human hands. In Nuremberg, almost within sight of Dürer’s house, I saw, about eight minutes after they began their stellar journey, some several rays of the sun describing the folds on the linen between my room and the city. #blindspot","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12093288_902077029863302_489444700_n.jpg"},

Almost all of it: it is also the most melancholy season, for, as Alkman says, there is nothing to eat. Resurrection is far too close to death, and the moment when the sleep begins to leave your eyes is the most fragile, the most porous, for at times in spring, even the emotional granaries are depleted. I remember the lines from Sans Soleil: \"Newspapers have been filled recently with the story of a man from Nagoya. The woman he loved died last year and he drowned himself in work—Japanese style—like a madman. It seems he even made an important discovery in electronics. And then in the month of May he killed himself. They say he could not stand hearing the word 'spring.'\" #blindspot","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12145550_1022566107765042_1049481254_n.jpg"},

The head turns away from its bearer. Another is an entry into a state of being carried. ​Outside a church in Lagos, a man sleeps. ​The body transitions from carrying itself across the earth into being carried by it, into giving itself up into that. The body of Christ is on the now-lowered cross. A white cloth is draped around him. He is not dead, only sleeping (a sleep of two nights and one long day). Around him at the moment of descent are John the Beloved, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, Mary Magdalene. Closest to him is his mother, in white. John holds out a larger white cloth with which to receive his body. The earth carries the cross. The cross carries the body. The body on the cross carries the world: in a state of sleep, one common dream is that of superhuman strength. It is said (in the Orthodox tradition) that the True Cross is made of cedar, pine, and cypress. It is said (by Calvin) that were all the fragments of the True Cross held in all the reliquaries of all the cathedrals of Europe to be assembled, an entire ship would be filled with the gathered wood. In sleep, one form of vision is foreclosed, and another becomes available. ​Outside an Anglican church in Lagos, t​he sleeping Christ dreams of sustenance and levitation. #blindspot","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12135248_536920916461491_657594085_n.jpg"},

There is that which drapes over, like a funeral sheath. Everywhere, I begin to see as I am carried along by my eyes, are these two energies, which, with water as the third, together begin to constitute an interpretive program: the ​solid (like wood, iron, or stone), the ​solid-​fluid (cloth like), and ​the fluid (​water​)​. On the banks of the Congo River one afternoon, a boy plays on a railing. He wears a white shirt and black gloves. Ahead of him is the cross on which he is supported​, reinterpreted as red elements of iron and painted concrete​. On ​the boy's body is the infant​ Christ's ​towel, the condemned Christ’s loincloth, the ​S​udarium of Saint Veronic​a​, the linen shroud of burial: white cloth on a body​, the solid-fluid that mediates between the cross and the river. Behind him, the river rushes. Is he a type of Christ, or is he an angel (that glove is as intense and uncanny as a pair of wings), or is he Saint Christopher, the Christ bearer at the river's lip? But all three are carriers, and types of each other too. Like them, the boy moves between metaphors. Suddenly, he lowers his head, his eyes disappear. #blindspot","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12141928_1094397320571544_326835735_n.jpg"},

In Christendom, visual interpretation proceeds by analogy. In a massive painted tryptich of the Descent from the Cross, with grief and care they bring him down, his helpless body now theirs to carry. John is there, and Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea. John wears red. On the right panel is a Visitation, in which the pregnant Madonna (she is great with child, she carries the Christ in her) visits her cousin Elizabeth. Where she (the Madonna) goes, he goes; she carries him. And she, like John in the central panel, and like Simeon in the right panel, wears red. “Nunc dimittis servum tuum, Domine, secundum verbum tuum in pace,” sings Simeon, as he lifts up the infant Christ. Along the blue-green Rhine on a hot summer’s day, the citizens of Basel, in their thousands are carried downriver. #fernweh","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11934760_1693919530829327_1553184055_n.jpg"},

Things have grain like painted concrete, or sheen like tarp, or weave like a net. The concrete is black, the tarp is slate blue, and the net is white.

In the city are things tied with little bits of white plastic to other things. Things touch and, like touched hands, are touched. Things are hooded. Blind man's buff is a premonition of the torture cell. Things contain shadow, fold, crinkle and tear. Edges bound things, boundaries edge things, and the skin of things enfolding them make them like us, who, in skins, are similarly contained, similarly enfolded. There are, in certain pictures of things, the sliver of the world beyond their thingness, the hot street, the storied building, the snick of white car, and the small long rectanglular powder blue of sky, which give those pictures their place and their life. #fernweh","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12144038_1835162373376727_2095990527_n.jpg"},

The streets were burning, and the heat was unbroken by rain. You could see all the tones inside the shadows. I had a hotel near the Messe, and went out walking in the heat. I would walk for hours with no destination in mind. Summer is pretty much the same everywhere: street food, stalls, and noise, the easy traffic of other people’s cultures. Then you take a turn and are in sudden sun-stunned streets of silence. In the mornings, in the cool of the hotel, I would read about people who had drowned in the Mediterranean the previous night. Then I would go out on long meanders, ferrying death with me. It is said Schubert never saw the sea.

This was sometimes accompanied by the obscene suggestion that perhaps he won this Swedish prize because he was Swedish himself. Familiar with those two hundred pages, I took the opposite view: any forty or fifty pages, drawn from Tranströmer's work at random, would have merited him all the top honors that literature has to offer.

On your departure from the pilgrimage site, the Presence comes with you in compact verisimilitude. The camera screen is St Veronica's cloth, a kind of contact printing. And it is this that a postcard does not and cannot replicate. If authenticity was previously thought to be guaranteed by location and the ritual of attendance, now it relies on the ritual of reproduction through photography and social media. Possibly there once was a tension between the real thing and its photographed other; possibly there was rivalry. Now, the reality of the real depends almost radically on its incessant reproduction in photography; and the lossy compression formats, as well as the scale of the phones, aid this process in so far as there’s no possiblity of confusing the real for its socialized image. Far from threatening the original, the photograph becomes its collateral, without which it cannot be disbursed. It is the secondary reality (the true likeness) by which the primary is recognized. #realrecognizereal","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11311271_1625530167687612_1829902739_n.jpg"},

Some of the intensity of the engagement comes from that. But there is something else, hinted at by the apparition of the crowd in the bulletproof glass: this holy image is protected, and is likely to outlast us. We are shadows in its presence. Lisa del Giocondo is long dead, but \"the Mona Lisa\" is not only five hundred years old, but likely to last another five hundred years. Objects outlive us anyway—most of the books in your home, your old leather shoes, the doorknobs, will be there after you die—but a protected object is even more likely to outlive us by far. Every painting in a museum becomes a memento mori. But the paradox of the Mona Lisa is that heightened interest in its objecthood simultaneously protects and endangers it (a skyscraper is at greater risk of terrorist attack than a rowhouse). Hence the theft (1911), the acid attack (1956), the thrown rock (1956 again, a bad year), the red paint (1974), the terracotta mug (2009). And yet, and yet: to look at the Mona Lisa is to look at something others long dead looked at, and at something others yet to be born will look at long after all our individual little habits are forgotten (this is what it means to die).","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11324272_1445518925776658_799615468_n.jpg"},

The big house is enormous. The small house is big. The greenhouse, derelict, contains no plants but is surrounded by the garden, which is healthy and profuse in July. I live in the small house, and see almost no one, except the gardeners who come every other day, two men from Central America somewhere, transplants, paragraphs dropped in from a different text. Dr Kavanagh and Mrs Kavanagh are both in their 80's, I'm told, but I'm yet to meet them. There has been wealth, there is wealth, and a certain way of doing things, coming gradually to an end now, perhaps. Trees shield Fair Ridge from the road and from the neighbors. The tree house implies grandchildren whom, also, I'm yet to see.","image":"https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11348220_859472507466444_1965300790_n.jpg"},

I take my offices among the July plants and the nooks of the greenhouse, lauds, vespers, compline, interrupting other duties for the sake of what the small camera is able to see.
