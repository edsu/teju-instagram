The stage is set. Things seem to be prepared in advance for cameos, and even the sun is rigged like the expert lighting of a technician. The boundary between things and props is now dissolved, and the images of things have become things themselves. Perhaps the artificer's gold paint is still wet on such scenes in which we play at kings. Wandering around, I find this theatricality of city life especially visible at the edges: the sleeping docks, the decrepit industries, the disused railroads: at such places, the city is shorn of all superfluity and reduced to its essentials, as in a play by Beckett. Flutes! Drums! Let the players in. #blindspot"

For weeks I saw nothing. Winter was hard. I woke up early in the mornings, 5.30. Schubert's Quintet in C, Björk's Vespertine. The first careful steps on the ice towards the unspooling day. I missed the train at times. I taught literature, art history, that winter I wrote essays, but lived in exile from my camera. Beck, Sufjan, Iyer. The ears were open but the eyes remained closed. Rhinecliff was the portal of this coming and going. I looked, saw nothing. Then something began to develop and I waited to recognize my face as it emerged from the tray.

All the cities are one city. What is interesting is to find, in this continuity of cities, the less-obvious differences of texture: the signs, the markings, the assemblages, the things hiding in plain sight in each cityscape or landscape: the way streetlights and traffic signs vary, the most common fonts, the slight variations in building codes, the fleeting ads, the way walls are painted, the noticeable shift in the range of hues that people wear, the color of human absence, the balance of industrial product versus what has been made by hand, greater or lesser degrees of finish, the visual melody of infrastructure as it interacts with terrain: wall, roof, plant, wire, gutter: what is everywhere but is everywhere slightly different. The time for essentialism is over. This is the age of specificity. #blindspot"

The Greek fleet was ready for war, but there were no winds, and they could not set sail. Why were there no winds? The goddess Diana's anger was turned against them. Agamemnon had killed a doe sacred to her, in her sacred grove in Aulis. There would be no winds, and no sailing, and no war, and no destruction of Troy, until she had her satisfaction. Agamemnon agreed to give away his daughter Iphegenia to Diana as a sacrifice. (Men are always giving women away.) In the scene the great painter Timanthes painted of Iphigenia's departure, Calchas was sorrowful, Odysseus was more sorrowful, and Menelaos was overcome with sorrow, all of which Timanthes portrayed with stunning accuracy. But the father Agamemnon's grief was greatest of all, a shattering extreme of grief, and Timanthes could not, or would not, go beyond the limit of what he had already shown.

The ascent of the Dom, on September 11, 1858, is typical in its details: The climber was the Rev. John Llewelyn-Davies, Cambridge-educated classicist and prominent vicar, who went up the mountain with the help of three Swiss guides. These were difficult climbs, and the risk involved was sufficient, in the words of one contemporary commentator, to ""lend climbing the dignity of danger.""

She said, though these are not her exact words: I have always felt that Open City was one way you approached the problem. You're still circling the problem now, she said, obsessed, she said, and approaching it in other ways. You will probably always be returning to it, she said.

But then I went to the cafeteria at the zoo, and there were the giraffes again, set into a new truth, their camelopardalic strangeness finding an answer in the unexpected setting. Camels travel far, have traveled far. There was Zarafa, given to Charles X by Mohammed Ali in 1826. There were the many little carved giraffes I saw for sale in the villages of Bali, wooden and painted in their incongruous hundreds, where actual giraffes had never been seen, a perfect illustration of how certain miracles of the kingdom animalia had become a shorthand for the artifacts of the international tourist trade.

A corner in the city is a sign of the city. The cityscape is full of hidden signs, and at times moral exigencies compel what was hidden to become visible. If you walk further down Niederkirchnerstrasse, you will find a strange complex of buildings and unearthed subterranean ruins. These buildings were the headquarters of the Gestapo and the SS, and nearby are other buildings that were used during the campaign of terror and mass murder that sent millions of people to their early deaths. There’s a cellar here, preserved, where political prisoners were tortured and killed. The site, now named the Topography of Terror, has been turned into a documentation center for these horrors. Evil ground because of what happened here, holy ground because of the innocents it consumed.

Sometimes the indication is crossways: the vessel carrying the image of the ship is the image of the bus. There are signs that say nothing, that reveal, like the poker-faced skull under all our facial expressions, the bedrock truth of it all. But almost as interesting as these signs of nothing are those signs that announce only that they are signs, signs that live as an homage to sign as sign.

In March 1498, the Nuremberg goldsmith and printer Anton Koberger published Ludovicus of Prussia’s ""Trilogium anime,"" for which Koberger’s godson Albrecht Dürer provided an illustration. Ludovicus, in his discussion of fantasia, touches on the composite nature of the chimera, that creature of legend whose hind parts were a dragon, the middle parts a goat, and the fore parts a lion. The world of dreams, Avicenna suggests, comes to pass when the rational brain gains unhindered access to the imagination’s storeroom of images. Dürer, considering the question of Beauty, wrote, ""I often see great art and good things while asleep which do not occur to me awake. However, when I wake up the memory of them is lost."" But from time to time, in certain heightened states in certain individuals, the boundary between the chimeras seen in dreams and the discrete forms of waking life to blur. In these sudden rifts in the natural order of time, prodigies of vision in the guise of hybrid forms can appear briefly before the critical faculty intervenes and the world rights itself again.

Then Jesus told him, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.'""— Six miles from Wannsee is Sanssouci, in Potsdam. When I made this photograph in Wannsee, I did not know that Caravaggio's The Incredulity of St Thomas was in Sanssouci. Has there been a more intense or more erotic demonstration of the sense of touch than in Caravaggio's painting? The split in Thomas’s shirt is the same size and shape as the wound in the side of Christ: both are eyes that short-circuit vision. Christ advises Thomas to surrender the sensual faculty in favor of the cognitive. But his hand, guiding Thomas's hand, says something different. Caravaggio, as usual, goes to that dark core where action splits from intention. I was based in Wannsee for the summer, and spent some of my time going to distant places in search of paintings by Caravaggio: to Madrid, Venice, Basel. I missed the Caravaggio right next door.

The gesture is doubled three times: in a fresco upstairs (for this is the Palazzo Ducale in Mantova), a little girl extends her arm to gently hold on to the fingers of her brother who, with his other hand, holds their father’s hand: a length, a loop, a line. #blindspot"

One of the common uses of the word “shadow” was as a synonym for “photograph.” This was the sense in which Sojourner Truth used it when she wrote, on the 1864 photographic postcard bearing her image, “I Sell The Shadow to Support the Substance.” Sojourner Truth’s photograph was made in Detroit, and she sold copies of it to raise funds for anti-slavery causes. Looking at the photo I made in Brooklyn, I’m reminded that “Detroit” used to be synonym for cars. Here is a shadow above, clearly labeled, and enmeshed below it, the substance (which, less shadowed, looks slightly less real). For a long time, I avoided having cars in my photographs. Now I know they are our shadow on the earth, our prosthesis. From time to time, I wake up in the middle of the night, heart pounding, and remember what another poet wrote: “Often the shadow is more real than the body. The samurai looks insignificant beside his armor of black dragon scales.” #blindspot"

I have seen both baths and graves done up in this style. As though to underscore the balneal theme, among the detritus between the two graves is a disused bathtub and an orange plastic bucket of the kind often found in Nigerian bathrooms. At the end of Book 10 of the Iliad, Odysseus and Diomedes spend a long night killing Thracians. ""Then the two warriors went down to the sea, and washed the sweat from their bodies, head to foot. When the waves had cleared the sweat, and they were refreshed, they went to gleaming baths to bathe further."" The overlap between the grave, the bath, the bed: strategic escapes from the burden of verticality. And, lying down, without even thinking about it, you close your eyes. ""Gleaming baths,"" Homer writes. Later on, Andromache draws a hot bath for her husband Hector who (she doesn't know this) is already dead.

I walk around the city not knowing if I am a giant in a miniature landscape or a midget in monumental surroundings. The bright sun obliterates scale. The city is modular: office plans look like city maps, and the facades of buildings resemble street plans. In this fractal city, each fragment is the city in microcosm. Glimmering things—narcotics, stimulants—are stacked and hover just out of reach behind grille and glass. The city is a druggy rush of machine: rectilinear, vertical, tantalising, and masked. You zoom in and in, and still remain recognizably in the city. Imagine the city destroyed, and out of one surviving miniature, out of the DNA, say, of a shopfront, the city had to be reconstructed—as in Jurassic Park. This is one possible city, the central city. The other is the city of peripheries, which with looser structure also contains the code of the city. Both cities are ever-present in the continuous city. #blindspot"

Masking is a brief return of childhood. The wrestler's mask, his ""persona,"" fuses him temporarily with the animal world. There is nothing innocent about this: it is dangerous and free. This why all discussion of whether wrestling is staged is irrelevant. Watching wrestlers in the 80s, I knew what was at stake. This was a space for totemic action, for animals and their cognates: caped heroes, peculiar professionals, and foreigners (Mr Fuji! Mr Saito!). Later, I lost track. Like all mature adults, my residual interest in wrestling was as objective as an anthropologist's during a ritual possession, and equally useless. But the masker forgets that he has two legs, that he uses the metric system, that he pays bills. Only when the masking ends does the persona underneath, long fused with the face, return. The mask of childhood covers everything but the eyes. The mask of adulthood covers the eyes and nothing else. #blindspot"

One of the smallest things in this picture—the reddish mound at the southwest corner of the red mesh—is in reality one of the largest. The picture was made at three thousand feet on Piz Corvatsch in the Engadin, and that wine-dark smudge is one of the great peaks of the Bernina Alps. From this point of view, it is about the same size in terms of area as the last small parcel of summer snow on the scree. Both are far smaller than the open shadows cast on the bottom left by unseen railings. Corvatsch was Nietzsche's favorite mountain, and maybe a line from ""Ecce Homo"" could caption this picture: ""Philosophy is a voluntary living in ice and high mountains."" But maybe not. Something less strident is needed for an inventory picture like this one, in which no square centimeter is allowed to lord it over any other one, just as we learn in school that a kilo of iron miraculously always weighs the same as kilo of feathers. Instead of philosophy, this is a picture of fact: siding, poles, mesh, sky, mountain, gravel, railing, and shadow, as well as color, angle, horizon, and loss of balance. #blindspot"

In the spring of 1507, Albrecht Dürer returned from his second trip to Italy. He had seen Leonardo's oil sketches​, and been impressed by their use of drapery to suggest form, movement, wind, and light. A folded drapery is cloth thinking about itself. Under pressure from itself or the influence of external agents, a material adopts a topographical surface. A material, around the axis of itself, faces some part of itself, confounds its inside and outside. A drapery study of Dürer’s from 1508 shows the influence of a sketch of Leonardo’s from the 1490s, now in the Louvre. Folding​: ​​""​falten​"":​ to bring something together, and also to iterate that bringing together: a joining and a repetition. In the crumples, pleat​s​, gathers, creases, ​falls, ​billows, ​and ​twists of cloth is a regular irregularity that is like the surface of water, like the channels of air, like God made visible. The human is the divine enfolded in skin. (There​ i​s a curious comment about folds in John​'​s account of the ​R​esurrection: a folded cloth that remained folded​ even as events unfolded​: ​""​Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus​'​ head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.​""​) To master the fold is to suggest a form not made by human hands. In Nuremberg, almost within sight of Dürer’s house, I saw, about eight minutes after they began their stellar journey, some several rays of the sun describing the folds on the linen between my room and the city. #blindspot"

There is more in the world, all of it proliferating like neural patterns. Almost all of it: it is also the most melancholy season, for, as Alkman says, there is nothing to eat. Resurrection is far too close to death, and the moment when the sleep begins to leave your eyes is the most fragile, the most porous, for at times in spring, even the emotional granaries are depleted.

John holds out a larger white cloth with which to receive his body. The earth carries the cross. The cross carries the body. The body on the cross carries the world: in a state of sleep, one common dream is that of superhuman strength. It is said (in the Orthodox tradition) that the True Cross is made of cedar, pine, and cypress. It is said (by Calvin) that were all the fragments of the True Cross held in all the reliquaries of all the cathedrals of Europe to be assembled, an entire ship would be filled with the gathered wood. In sleep, one form of vision is foreclosed, and another becomes available. ​Outside an Anglican church in Lagos, t​he sleeping Christ dreams of sustenance and levitation. #blindspot"

There is that which is carried, like a cross. There is that which drapes over, like a funeral sheath. Everywhere, I begin to see as I am carried along by my eyes, are these two energies, which, with water as the third, together begin to constitute an interpretive program: the ​solid (like wood, iron, or stone), the ​solid-​fluid (cloth like), and ​the fluid (​water​)​. On the banks of the Congo River one afternoon, a boy plays on a railing. He wears a white shirt and black gloves. Ahead of him is the cross on which he is supported​, reinterpreted as red elements of iron and painted concrete​. On ​the boy's body is the infant​ Christ's ​towel, the condemned Christ’s loincloth, the ​S​udarium of Saint Veronic​a​, the linen shroud of burial: white cloth on a body​, the solid-fluid that mediates between the cross and the river. Behind him, the river rushes. Is he a type of Christ, or is he an angel (that glove is as intense and uncanny as a pair of wings), or is he Saint Christopher, the Christ bearer at the river's lip? But all three are carriers, and types of each other too. Like them, the boy moves between metaphors. Suddenly, he lowers his head, his eyes disappear. #blindspot"

This country has no sea. It is not near the Mediterranean. In Christendom, visual interpretation proceeds by analogy. In a massive painted tryptich of the Descent from the Cross, with grief and care they bring him down, his helpless body now theirs to carry. John is there, and Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea. John wears red. On the right panel is a Visitation, in which the pregnant Madonna (she is great with child, she carries the Christ in her) visits her cousin Elizabeth. Where she (the Madonna) goes, he goes; she carries him. And she, like John in the central panel, and like Simeon in the right panel, wears red. “Nunc dimittis servum tuum, Domine, secundum verbum tuum in pace,” sings Simeon, as he lifts up the infant Christ. Along the blue-green Rhine on a hot summer’s day, the citizens of Basel, in their thousands are carried downriver. #fernweh"

Things have grain like painted concrete, or sheen like tarp, or weave like a net. The concrete is black, the tarp is slate blue, and the net is white. Things are draped over other things, and tied to other things. Something is protecting something, keeping something from view. In the city are things tied with little bits of white plastic to other things. Things touch and, like touched hands, are touched. Things are hooded. Blind man's buff is a premonition of the torture cell. Things contain shadow, fold, crinkle and tear. Edges bound things, boundaries edge things, and the skin of things enfolding them make them like us, who, in skins, are similarly contained, similarly enfolded. There are, in certain pictures of things, the sliver of the world beyond their thingness, the hot street, the storied building, the snick of white car, and the small long rectanglular powder blue of sky, which give those pictures their place and their life. #fernweh"

Temperatures had soared. The streets were burning, and the heat was unbroken by rain. You could see all the tones inside the shadows. I had a hotel near the Messe, and went out walking in the heat. I would walk for hours with no destination in mind. Summer is pretty much the same everywhere: street food, stalls, and noise, the easy traffic of other people’s cultures. Then you take a turn and are in sudden sun-stunned streets of silence. In the mornings, in the cool of the hotel, I would read about people who had drowned in the Mediterranean the previous night. Then I would go out on long meanders, ferrying death with me. It is said Schubert never saw the sea. He wrote of it often, he wrote many settings that evoked the sea. #fernweh"

Barcelona. Unable to think, unable to write, some mood takes hold of me and I wander through the streets for hours. One street, another street, darkness, sudden light, piles of trash, and a kind of demonic sadness bobbing ahead of me like a shadow. Here and there, I see someone digging through the dumpsters for food. Europe is sick, maybe dying. I don't know. I'm a needle made of pine in a pine forest. At a corner, I take a photo of the day's offering, assembled by chance as though by Rauschenberg or Tàpies. Then I look up. ""En aquesta casa va viure l’escriptor i poeta Roberto Bolaño Ávalos (Santiago de Xile 1953–Barcelona 2003)."" Chance!

Not per the meaning of the work, but per the languages within which aspects of it are legible. Possibly this question is rarer because our society values hierarchies over networks, fathers over friends. But if you say X influenced Y and leave it at that, you have stated something much less alive than showing how X, Y, A, B, and N are in communication with each other, and even how, within a given network, streams of influence can sometimes run upstream."

This was sometimes accompanied by the obscene suggestion that perhaps he won this Swedish prize because he was Swedish himself.

How many of us were killed by the Baath regime before the war? How many archaeologists, historians, and art historians were killed in the American bombing of Baghdad? How many carvers, how many oud-makers, how many masters of the maqam, how many singers? How many of those who cherish the past on behalf of the future? But no one keeps such a tally. 🌴
The young man in Room 406, in black shirt, black shorts, black shoes, black socks, goes from case to case, with rare attention. He plays nervously with his hands, but his face is serene."

There are only two other people in Room 406. One of them is a young man in black t-shirt and black shorts. The museum will close soon. Outside is the city. Late afternoon. Summer is almost over. Many languages flow through the streets, many people, and the UN building is a marine green in the August light. 🌴
On June 26, 1980, a putsch against President Hafez al-Asad fails. The Muslim Brotherhood is deemed responsible. The next day, commando forces, under orders from Rifa’al al-Asad, the president’s brother, go to Tadmor Prison with orders to kill every prisoner, whether they are connected to the Muslim Brotherhood or not. The commandos arrive at dawn. The prisoners are in their cells, and the commandos go from one cell to another. No records are kept, but about a thousand prisoners are believed killed. 🌴
The ancient city of Tadmor (a possible etymological link with the Arabic tamr, “dates,” but this is unproven), an oasis in the Syrian desert for millennia, becomes, under Greco-Roman influence around the 1st century C.E., Palmyra (the name evokes date palms). Underneath Palmyra, Tadmor persists: the local dialect of Aramaic, carved into limestone stele as “Palmyrene,” the Arab Queen Zenobia, who fights, and wins, and loses, and is carried off to Rome in gold chains. 🌴
Parthian (later “Persian”) dress, Greek style, in this place where cultures meet. The faces are frontal, both idealized and stylized, and responsive to second and third century C.E. Roman portraiture. The simplified folds of the robes fall like palmate leaves. The snicks of Palmyrene script are dry fronds."

It is a vengeance wreaked on the past in order to embitter the future. And how often it is that those who destroy ruins are the same ones who desecrate bodies. 🌴
I need to understand what I am sad about. Not in hopes of obliterating the sadness, but in hopes of lessening it. 🌴
Underneath modern Tadmor was Tadmor Prison. The dungeon was built for horror. The population was in the thousands. To keep the population fearful, random prisoners were dragged to death, or cut to pieces with an axe. Above stood the ancient ruins. The Syrian poet Faraj Bayrakdar, held at Tadmor Prison for five years for his communist ideas, called it “a kingdom of death and madness.” 🌴
Alas! Tadmor, the wife of Moqîmu son of Nûrbel, the artisan. She died on the 29th day of Siwan in the year 457 (June, 146 C.E.). 🌴
I displace what hurts, what cuts, onto some other object charged with a local pain from ages ago. The mourners and the ones they mourned are eighteen centuries gone. Their pain—“Alas!”—remains fresh. 🌴
The way the women raise their right hand to touch, delicately, the hem of their robes. Their irises incised, their pupils doubly incised, into the limestone."

On your departure from the pilgrimage site, the Presence comes with you in compact verisimilitude. The camera screen is St Veronica's cloth, a kind of contact printing. And it is this that a postcard does not and cannot replicate. If authenticity was previously thought to be guaranteed by location and the ritual of attendance, now it relies on the ritual of reproduction through photography and social media. Possibly there once was a tension between the real thing and its photographed other; possibly there was rivalry. Now, the reality of the real depends almost radically on its incessant reproduction in photography; and the lossy compression formats, as well as the scale of the phones, aid this process in so far as there’s no possiblity of confusing the real for its socialized image. Far from threatening the original, the photograph becomes its collateral, without which it cannot be disbursed. It is the secondary reality (the true likeness) by which the primary is recognized. #realrecognizereal"

No photographer credited (only the institution), no time, no date, probably photographed in a lab. It lacks everything except a steely perfection. And they've cut off the most interesting part of the image: her hands. A mistake an amateur would never make."

Some of the intensity of the engagement comes from that. But there is something else, hinted at by the apparition of the crowd in the bulletproof glass: this holy image is protected, and is likely to outlast us. We are shadows in its presence. Lisa del Giocondo is long dead, but ""the Mona Lisa"" is not only five hundred years old, but likely to last another five hundred years. Objects outlive us anyway—most of the books in your home, your old leather shoes, the doorknobs, will be there after you die—but a protected object is even more likely to outlive us by far. Every painting in a museum becomes a memento mori. But the paradox of the Mona Lisa is that heightened interest in its objecthood simultaneously protects and endangers it (a skyscraper is at greater risk of terrorist attack than a rowhouse). Hence the theft (1911), the acid attack (1956), the thrown rock (1956 again, a bad year), the red paint (1974), the terracotta mug (2009). And yet, and yet: to look at the Mona Lisa is to look at something others long dead looked at, and at something others yet to be born will look at long after all our individual little habits are forgotten (this is what it means to die)."

They are always present as faint apparitions in the bullet-proof glass. She contains us all. There are two exceptions to this. The first is when she is removed (when it is removed) for official photography. (When the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911, it took a while to recognize the theft, because everyone assumed that it was in the photo department, being photographed.) The second exception is when a private tour is given—but that is not a privilege granted mere mortals.

A dozen cameras later, digital and film, approximately 85,000 pictures later, I credit her with a catalytic role in my journey. N. died today. Aneurysm. She used to laugh a lot. She liked a party, she was 37. You have gone to that place where it is too dark to see."

The big house is enormous. The small house is big. The greenhouse, derelict, contains no plants but is surrounded by the garden, which is healthy and profuse in July. I live in the small house, and see almost no one, except the gardeners who come every other day, two men from Central America somewhere, transplants, paragraphs dropped in from a different text. Dr Kavanagh and Mrs Kavanagh are both in their 80's, I'm told, but I'm yet to meet them. There has been wealth, there is wealth, and a certain way of doing things, coming gradually to an end now, perhaps. Trees shield Fair Ridge from the road and from the neighbors. The tree house implies grandchildren whom, also, I'm yet to see."

For this more limited world, I use different means: grayscale, no film, no tripod, no special lenses, only an iPhone. The conceptual opportunities are limited; irony grows poorly in this soil. But the limits are only physical, not imaginative. It is the same sun, come the same distance to bless the glass and awe the spiderweb. I take my offices among the July plants and the nooks of the greenhouse, lauds, vespers, compline, interrupting other duties for the sake of what the small camera is able to see. I had imagined, in a sequence I have only briefly set aside, in a sequence that ranged that wider world, that the one to whom she wrote was in some seclusion, receiving those words and images here, and so I self-fulfill the prophecy, here among the still lives and living things of a garden in Omaha."

Below it, deeper than it, if it is given time, is a recognition not only that all mobility tends towards immobility, and that all those who walk freely now will soon enough have trouble walking at all, but also that deceleration is accompanied by special forms of knowledge: that the landscape—and therefore the world of experiences—unfolds at a different pace for those, young or old, who have trouble walking."

Wandering around, I find this theatricality of city life especially visible at the edges: the sleeping docks, the decrepit industries, the disused railroads: at such places, the city is shorn of all superfluity and reduced to its essentials, as in a play by Beckett.
